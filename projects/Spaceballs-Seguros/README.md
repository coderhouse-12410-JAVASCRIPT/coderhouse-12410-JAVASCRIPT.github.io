This is an online insurance quote tool developed for my Javascript Course.
<br>
Still learning. Productive feedback is always welcome :)
<br><br>
Features:
<br>
- On the "Cotizador" tab user completes the requested form and it is validated to make sure all mandatory fields are completed prior to offering an insurance quote.
<br>
- Ships are brought from https://swapi.dev/.
<br>
- If a ship is 10 years old or older user will receive a message informing we can´t insure it.
<br>
- When al fields are validated the "Validar Datos" button will change to "Cotizar Poliza"
<br>
- When the user gets the insurance quote he/she can accept, and closing message will appear or decline. If the user chooses "Desestimar" then the previously disabled "Cotizción Previa" button will become active. All the data from the last quote offered will be stored for future reference.
<br>
- A side toggle button for dark or light ("side of the force") is also available.
<br>
- Easter egg on the "Términos y Condiciones" link.
